the Internet of Things or IoT for short, which is a rather broad term that can be used to describe any collection of physical computing devices that can communicate with each other over a network or the Internet.

But coming back to the world of IoT, that might be a little more familiar to most of us, typical devices include things such as televisions, home appliances, smart speakers, light switches, and plugs, thermostats, security systems, and IP cameras, streaming media devices, medical devices, our cars, fire alarms, and smoke detectors, and fitness devices, any of which might be in use in your home right now. So, even if you weren't familiar with what an IoT implementation might involve, you might already be using one.
